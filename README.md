# odin-etch-a-sketch

This is my attempt at the Etch a Sketch project from The Odin Project's foundation course.

This version of the project meets all the requirements laid out in the project description:

* Creates a 16x16 grid of pixels upon first loading the page using JavaScript
* Colours in the pixels on the grid when hovering over them with the mouse similar to using a pen on paper
* Allows the user to make a new grid of a different size, going up to 100x100 pixels. The pixels remain square shaped and fit within a maximum width without becoming distorted

Additional features added beyond the requirements:
* Allows the user to reset/clear the grid by pressing the "Clear" button
